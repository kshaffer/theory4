## In class on Monday, April 4

First, while listening to the piece, think about how you would approach the following general questions:

- What is the form of the passage?  
- What does the title mean?  
- Which theories/tools do you have at your disposal that are likely to reveal something interesting or important about the piece?

We will discuss these briefly as a whole class.

Then, try to answer the following questions (first as an individual, then in a group of 3–4 people). Once you begin work as a group, add your answers to the class Google Doc for this piece (accessible only when logged in with CU account): [9am section](https://docs.google.com/a/colorado.edu/document/d/1otLD9YBTGLB3TsyiG-8995JYe45u7qMt6sRJi9fuO80/edit?usp=sharing), [10am section](https://docs.google.com/a/colorado.edu/document/d/1660BN42d_OTaQL6iVymB_SXXG34vPoyf26KdVn55yuA/edit?usp=sharing).

- Find an example of each of the following (please do not duplicate another group's answer):  
  - A diatonic melody.  
  - A chromatic melody.  
  - An octatonic melody.  
  - A whole-tone melody.  
  - Quartal (stacked-fourths-based) or quintal (stacked-fifths-based) chords.  
- Why do you think Stravinsky used quintuple rhythms at rehearsal 151 and following, instead of inserting 5/8 bars like he does elsewhere in the movement?  
- Is there a regularity or structural pattern to the rhythm at rehearsal 142 (same at 167)?  
  - If yes, what is it?  
  - If no, why do you think Stravinsky used an irregular pattern?  
- Is there a regularity or structural pattern to the rhythm at rehearsal 149?  
  - If yes, what is it?  
  - If no, why do you think Stravinsky used an irregular pattern?  
- In the last two bars, why do you think the high parts and the low parts arrive at different moments?


## Homework for Wednesday's class (April 6)

Review the answers you and your colleagues provided on the Google Doc. There will be a closed-note quiz at the beginning of Wednesday's class, in which you will be given a series of melodic excerpts from "The Sacrificial Dance" and asked to ID the collection governing the excerpt. Most excerpts will be taken from the Google Doc. Please review any collections that are still unfamiliar, as well as the collaborative Google Doc that includes many of these excerpts already analyzed. (If you find errors in the Google Doc, be sure to fix them, in case those excerpts are on the quiz!)

Also, watch at least "The Sacrificial Dance" in each of the following videos. (Both are attempts to recapture Nijinsky's original choreography.)

*"Sacrificial Dance" begins at 29:28 in the following video from the 100th-anniversary performance from the Ballett und Orchester Mariinski-Theater Sankt Petersburg at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées.*

*"Sacrificial Dance" begins at 4:25 in the following video from the Joffrey Ballet (Chicago).*

Then revisit the questions from Monday. Write down new/revised answers to the questions, and bring them to class.


## In class on Wednesday, April 6

We will begin with the collection ID quiz described above.

Then we will move on to comparing your new answers to the above questions (the second set about collections, rhythms, etc.) with your group mates. (If you worked on the homework with others, compare answers with *different* classmates in class.) Come to the best consensus you can.

Then consider the following question in your groups:

- Why is there such a difference in tempo between the San Francisco Symphony recording and the Joffrey Ballet video?

Then we will follow with a whole-class discussion about these questions to see what consensus we can arrive at as a whole class.
