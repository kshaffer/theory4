Whether teaching, writing, running rehearsals, or collaborating with other performers, most professional musicians work on a daily basis with non-musicians or with musicians whose specific area of musical expertise is different. Writing and speaking about music with accurate detail and nuance in a way that can be understood by those with different areas of expertise is an absolutely essential skill for twenty-first-century musicians. Indeed, the ability to write and speak with accuracy and nuance about a domain we know well, for a non-expert audience, is an important skill for a variety of career and life situations. Thus, to cap our studies of musical structures in the core theory/aural-skills sequence, we will focus on developing this important skill. 

The standard for written assignments in university courses has long been the academic essay. We will engage academic writing this semester. However, because most of you will not go on to careers in academia, we will place a large emphasis on non-academic writing. And since most reading/writing these days happens on the web, we will place an emphasis specifically on digital writing ― doing things that you can't do in traditional print-based writing. 

At the end of this semester, you will have experience writing about musical structures in both small and medium forms, for academic and popular audiences, in print and digital formats. Small weekly writing assignments will help you solidify your understanding of pieces and concepts engaged in class, as well as hone some of the basic skills of clear analytical writing. Larger written projects at the end of the German Lieder unit and the post-tonal unit will help you pull together the analytical and writing skills honed during the unit into a larger form.

Following are details for each of the writing assignment types. All writing assignments count towards the Music Theory 4 final grade.

## Weekly paragraphs

Starting approximately in Week 6, you will write a weekly analysis paragraph in which you recount details and consolidate your understanding of a piece covered in class during that week. These are not new analyses, but an opportunity to solidify your understanding and practice your writing about musical structures before doing more involved analytical writing on your own. In these paragraphs, please do the following:

1. Write between 100 and 200 words.  
2. Include at least three specific (and accurate!) musical details about the piece about which you are writing.  
3. Include a thesis statement/topic sentence ― a single-sentence expression of the main idea you want to communicate about the piece.  
4. Make sure that the musical details you include (#2) connect to the thesis statement (#3). If they do not make an obvious connection, then make that connection explicit in your writing.  
5. Do not include any details that do not connect to your thesis statement.  

Paragraphs will be assessed passed/attempted/not-attempted. Passed paragraphs receive full credit, attempted half credit, not attempted no credit. Paragraphs will be assessed on #1–3 above, but will receive feedback on #1–5. Paragraphs that meet the requirements of #1–3 will pass. If any requirements are not met, they will be marked as attempted only. There is no reassessment opportunity for paragraphs because it is important that they are written immediately after the in-class analysis has taken place in order to serve their purpose. However, the lowest paragraph grade will be dropped from the final course grade.


## Twitter essays

Please do the following when writing your Twitter essay:

1. Read Jesse Stommel's article, [The Twitter Essay](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/the-twitter-essay/).   
2. Formulate a concise, novel insight about a poem, piece of music, or theoretical concept we have recently studied.  
3. Compose an essay of *exactly 140 characters*, including the hashtag #TwitterEssay and either #Lieder or #PostTonal (depending on the genre you are writing about). As Jesse says, "Play, innovate, incite." It can look like the thesis statement for a longer essay. But try to do something more, or at least more interesting. Push the (very limited) boundaries of the genre you are using.  
4. Submit your Twitter essay according to the specific assignment instructions.

Jesse's article contains some examples. You can also [search Twitter for examples](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TwitterEssay&src=typd). (Note that not all of these results follow Jesse's rubric. There are many kinds of Twitter essays.)  

Twitter essays will be graded pass/not-pass. Those which are exactly 140 characters (including the hashtags) and which say something non-trivial about the poem/piece/concept in question will pass. Exemplary Twitter essays will be published (anonymously) on the [@CUBoulderTheory](https://twitter.com/cubouldertheory) class Twitter account and/or shared in class. 

There are no reassessment opportunities for Twitter essays, but the lowest grade (in other words, one missed/not-passed Twitter essay) will be dropped from the final grade.

## Academic papers

Each student will write one standard academic paper at the end of the German Lieder unit.

These papers should be 1000–1500 words (4–6 pages typed, double-spaced), should have a single analytical thesis, should argue that thesis with supporting evidence and no extraneous details, and should conform to the *Chicago Manual of Style*, 16th. ed. (This is *not* a genre in which we will be pushing stylistic boundaries, but instead working on excelling at artful conformity: meeting set expectations while also standing out via a strong argument and/or well crafted prose.)

Examples of model essays from past student work (anonymous) will be provided in advance of the due dates, along with detailed instructions for the analytical aspects of the assignment.


## Blog essays ("blessays")

Each student will write one ["blessay"](http://www.dancohen.org/2012/05/24/the-blessay/) of about 500 words at the end of the post-tonal unit.

These essays can engage any piece of music discussed during the post-tonal unit, or a different piece of the student's choosing that is approved by Kris. They should be aimed at a non-specialist audience — either non-musicians or at least practicing musicians who have not studied music theory formally.

When writing these "blessays," do the following:

1. Read Dan Cohen's explanation of the [blessay](http://www.dancohen.org/2012/05/24/the-blessay/) and Jesse Stommel's blog post, ["What is Good Writing?: A Meditation on Breaking Rules and Grammar Pedagogy"](http://learning.instructure.com/2014/06/what-is-good-writing-a-meditation-on-breaking-rules-and-grammar-pedagogy/).  
2. Formulate a concise, novel insight about a poem, piece of music, or musical concept we have recently studied.  
3. Gather supporting data/evidence in support of that insight.  
4. Compose a blog post that explains your insight using some or all of your supporting evidence.  
5. Write in clear prose that is generally gramatically correct and logically organized. However, you must also *break at least one rule* of good writing that you have learned in the past, or *use at least one novel feature of web-based writing that is unavailable in print*. Do so in the service of communicating your insight more effectively. For example, you can embed a Spotify audio track or a YouTube video. You can alternate between normal and backwards/upside-down text to make a point about symmetry in the musical structure. Incomplete sentences. (See what I did there?) Mixing languages. Something that pushes the boundaries of traditional writing in the way that the poets and composers we discuss push the boundaries of poetic and musical structure.  
6. Submission instructions TBA.
