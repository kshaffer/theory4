## Unit II prepared performance portfolio instructions ##

This assignment is designed to help you build connections between your primary instrument/voice experience and the post-tonal pitch and rhythm elements of this unit.

There are two short excerpts, one from Leonard Bernstein's "Jeremiah" Symphony and one from Béla Bartók's Concerto for Orchestra. **Sing the "Jeremiah" Symphony excerpt with solfège (it modulates once) while conducting the asymmetrical meter** and **play the Bartók on an instrument of your choosing.**

Following are the scores for these two excerpts. Download the scores for your clef.

- [Bernstein, treble clef](/media/Bernstein-treble.pdf)  
- [Bernstein, alto clef](/media/Bernstein-alto.pdf)  
- [Bernstein, bass clef](/media/Bernstein-bass.pdf)  
- [Bartók, treble clef](/media/Bartok-treble.pdf)  
- [Bartók, alto clef](/media/Bartok-alto.pdf)  
- [Bartók, bass clef](/media/Bartok-bass.pdf)  

Practice performing them until you can perform them *accurately* and *at the tempo indicated*, while observing all expressive markings. Once you are performing the excerpt consistently well, record it and upload your videos to the D2L dropbox. Be sure that we can see your conducting pattern in the video.

These two excerpts will be assessed individually as passed (full-credit), attempted (half-credit), or not attempted (no credit). Performances submitted on time but not passed will be allowed one reassessment opportunity. 

All videos most be submitted and must be performed *perfectly or nearly so and at the given tempo* by **Thursday, March 31, 8am.**
