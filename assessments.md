## Grades (from the syllabus)

The most important and interesting aspects of learning are things that are difficult to assess fairly and reductively (i.e., with a single letter). As a result, heavy emphasis on grades tends to [undermine alternative perspectives](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/syllabus-manifesto-critical-approach-classroom-culture/)—the exact opposite of what a liberal education should do.

My goal in grading is three-fold: to diminish the significance and the negative impact grades can have on the learning environment, to direct your studies clearly (but flexibly) to specific areas that need attention, and to make sure that grades do carry some meaningful representation of the knowledge and skills you possess and gain by the end of the course.

With that in mind, assessment will be oriented around specific concepts and skills, and in order to facilitate learing, the bulk of the assessments will either allow collaboration or reassessment, if not passed on the first attempt. All assessments within a category will be weighted equally.

I have done my best to keep the assessment simple, especially since there will naturally be a little confusion about the way that this combined course will produce separate grades for theory and aural skills. All assignments will be clearly marked as counting towards theory or aural skills, and all of the section instructors, graders, and I will do our best to ensure that the course gradesbooks (in D2L) are continually up-to-date. However, when questions and confusions inevitably arise, it is your responsibility to talk to your section instructor or to me as soon as you can so that we can straighten things out.

### Final grade calculation

Following are assessment types that comprise the final Theory 4 grade:

- **Online quizzes (open-note)** - 20% of the final Theory 4 grade.  
- **Daily/weekly assignments, in-class quizzes, and Twitter essays** - 60% of the final Theory 4 grade.  
- **Academic essay midterm** - 10% of the final Theory 4 grade.  
- **"Blessay" (blog/essay) final** - 10% of the final Theory 4 grade.  

Following are assessment types that comprise the final Aural Skills 4 grade:

- **Prepared performance (voice and/or instrument)** - 30% of the final Aural Skills 4 grade.  
- **Sight-reading (voice and/or instrument)** - 20% of the final Aural Skills 4 grade.  
- **Transcription** - 50% of the final Aural Skills 4 grade.  

Below are written and/or video descriptions of the activities that will be assessed during this course. Where applicable, examples are also provided.

*Some of the assessment practices may be unfamiliar to you. For more information on why I grade the way that I do, please see my blog post, ["Why Grade?"](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/2014/07/why-grade/). I am glad to answer any questions you have (the earlier the better) and to entertain proposals for changes or exceptions (again, the earlier the better).*


## Reading/video quizzes (at-home)

There will be one or two reading/video assignments most weeks, with online reading quizzes due to be completed by 8am on Monday and/or Wednesday. These quizzes will run in the D2L site for Theory 4, and will count towards the Theory 4 grade.

Online quizzes will be open-note, will include mostly informational questions, and will be graded by percentage of questions answered correctly. Most quizzes will contain one or two questions that are created in order to get you thinking about conceptual issues that we will engage during class, and to give me information about everyone's general level of understanding before class. These questions will receive full credit for any honest attempt, regardless of correctness, and will be labeled as "graded for attempt only."

While these quizzes are open-note and collaboration is allowed, I highly encourage you to attempt them individually without consulting readings or notes, and then go back to your notes (and/or your study partner's notes) and correct any mistakes before submitting your answers. This will give you both practice recalling the information and feedback when you are incorrect — two of the most helpful things for memorizing information correctly (and preparing for in-class quizzes).

The goal for these quizzes is to promote the memorization of basic information that we will be addressing and applying in class, and to promote long-term retention of information engaged in this course. Thus, they must be done regularly and *before* we work through these concepts in class. There are no reassessment opportunities for quizzes. However, the lowest 20% of quiz grades will be dropped when calculating your final grade. 


## Application assignments (theory)

Most weeks will involve small-scale assignments and/or in-class quizzes in which you will cultivate and/or demonstrate your skills in applying the concepts of the week (and possibly those covered in previous weeks) in a musical task. These will generally be due by 8am on Mondays, and will count toward the Theory 4 grade. Submit via the dropbox on the Theory 4 D2L site, unless given different instructions.

These application assignments will include voice-leading exercises, harmonic reductions, harmonic/melodic/formal analyses, composition exercises, etc. For each assignment type, you will be provided with specific instructions and a model assignment to consult as you work. 

## Synthesis projects 

Each major unit of study will contain an end-of-unit analytical project in which you will demonstrate the ability to synthesize many, if not all, of the concepts covered in that unit and express them in writing. See the [Writing guide](/writing/) for more information.


## Prepared performance

In each unit of study, you will create a portfolio of prepared performance videos. Videos will be submitted in the dropbox of the Aural Skills 4 D2L site, and will count toward the Aural Skills 4 grade.

Make a video of yourself performing each of the pieces in the portfolio. Each video in the portfolio will be assessed according to a 2-point rubric:

- 2 points: Passed. Accurate, concert-ready performance.  
- 1 point: Attempted (half-credit). An honest attempt, but not yet concert-ready.  
- 0 points: Not attempted. No attempt made, or video reflects little-to-no preparation.  

Video performances will generally be due early in the unit, submitted by 8am on Mondays. Videos receiving 1 point will be allowed to submit a second video one week after the original due date, in order to re-attempt the full 2 points (accurate, concert-ready performance). Further reassessments *may* be allowed, at the discretion of the Tuesday/Thursday section instructor.

Details about specific pieces, collaboration options, etc. will be provided as performance videos are assigned.


## Live performance (from sight or improvized)

This course contains the following three live-performance objectives:

- Sight-read a modulating melody in the style of a German Lied, sung with solfège.  
- Sight-read a melody that makes use of an asymmetrical meter, on an instrument of choice.  
- Sight-read a melody in a post-tonal style that makes use of one of the post-tonal modes/collections covered in this unit.  

These will be assessed via individual in-person exams that will take the place of a Tuesday/Thursday section. They will be graded according to the rubrics below, and will count towards the Aural Skills 4 grade. Two exam slots will be reserved for the Lied objective, and three exam slots will be reserved for the two post-tonal objectives. Students may attempt each objective once or twice. (Additional attempts will only be provided at the discretion of the Tuesday/Thursday section instructor.) Only the best score for each objective will count toward the final grade. 

Grades for each sight-reading exam will be assigned as follows:

- 3 points: a (nearly) flawless performance on the first or second attempt.  
- 2 points: a strong performance with a few small mistakes, or which requires more than two attempts to sound concert-ready.  
- 1 point: an honest attempt, but with significant errors.  
- 0 points: no attempt or performance reflects little-to-no preparation.



## Transcription

This semester will contain a number of short, full-textured transcriptions, in both Romantic (typically Lieder) and post-tonal styles. Transcriptions will count toward the Aural Skills 4 grade.

These transcriptions will take place part in-class and part take-home. (Usually, beginning the transcription in Thursday's section, and finishing for an online submission by Monday morning.) For Unit I (Romantic era), you will be given a short (typically 15–20 seconds long), modulating passage of a German art song, and you will be told the starting pitch of the melody. You will be given 20–25 minutes at the end of class to transcribe the melody and key relationships (starting key, ending key, modulation type). Then you will complete the transcription (finish or correct the melody and key relationships, add accompaniment and harmonic analysis) by the due date.

Because these transcriptions will begin in class, but will be self-paced, ***you will need to bring an appropriate device to class in order to access the audio.*** Please contact Kris and/or your section instructor if this poses difficulty for you, and we'll work something out.

Each Romantic-era transcription will be evaluated for accuracy of four musical features:

- melody (pitch, rhythm, and register)  
- accompaniment (pitch, rhythm, and register)  
- harmony (Roman numerals and cadences)  
- key relationships (starting key, ending key, modulation types)  

Each of these features will be given a score on the following 3-point scale (total of 12 points per transcription):

- 3 points: a performance-ready transcription (most professional musicians would not be able to tell that it contained mistakes).  
- 2 points: mostly correct, but with 1–3 mistakes that a professional musician would notice in a performance.  
- 1 point: more than three noticeable mistakes.  
- 0 points: not attempted, or attempt reflects little-to-no substantive effort.

*Melody and key relationship work done in-class (without an instrument or MIDI playback via software) will receive full credit, at-home will receive half credit. Accompaniment and harmony transcription can be done at-home for full credit.* 

Thus, a solid transcription done entirely at-home can receive up to a C (75%). Substantial progress on the in-class portion can bring that up to a B. A (nearly) correct in-class transcription followed by (nearly) correct take-home work will receive an A.

The best two Romantic-era transcriptions and the best two post-tonal transcriptions will count towards the final grade.

I have made a [video demo](https://vimeo.com/119572881) of my classical transcription process.

Your section instructor will give you specific submission instructions for these assignments. The final, take-home transcription will be notated with notation software and submitted via a D2L dropbox. The in-class portion will either be submitted on paper (take a picture or make a quick copy before you leave, so you can use it as the basis of your take-home transcription), or by the instructor taking a picture of your work before you leave.
