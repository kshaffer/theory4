Music is an art. Music is a language. Music is therapy. Music is [a clinical tool](http://www.musictherapy.org). Music is a [weapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_psychological_operations). Music is an area of humanistic inquiry. Music is math. Music is neuroscience. Music is communal. Music is deeply personal. Music is [bug spray](http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/13/entertainment/ca-musichurts13). Music is religion. Music is [identity formation](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL3505052W/Music_in_Everyday_Life). Music is culture. Music is psychology.

Music is nearly unparalleled in its ability to engage just about every facet of our lives. Perhaps only language has the same reach into our biology, psychology, individual identity, and social community. Music both frames, and is dependent on, our memory. Music both affects and flows from our emotions. Music both embodies and transcends cultural prejudice. And despite its heavily scientific base, even professional musicians treat it with an air of mystery.

One goal of the music theory course sequence is to demistify musical structure, to help you as current and aspiring professional musicians understand the ways in which a variety of types of music are constructed, and what meanings can be attached to those structures. And if theory represents the conceptual side of musical structure and meaning, then aural skills represents (part of) the practical side ― uniting meaning with structure through musical practice. 

This year, we are piloting the combination of theory and aural skills into a single course. Since the combination of theory and practice is often referred to as *praxis*, we could easily call this course Music Praxis. Some universities that treat these topics together call it simply Musicianship. We'll just call it Music Theory and Aural Skills. But note that this year, we will not be treating "written" and "aural" as two separate entities. Theory and practice, concept and embodiment, are inextricably linked in reality, and we will intentionally link them in our work this year.

Because this is a pilot, there are a few administrative things that are less than ideal. For one, this combined course will receive two final grades ― one for theory and one for aural skills. There will also be separate D2L sites. We will do everything we can to make the logistics as smooth as possible. But please be patient with the institutional bureaucracies and technological intricacies.

## Required course materials

- [*Open Music Theory*](http://www.openmusictheory.com) (free web access).  
- A web-enabled device that is capable of reading online text, accessing the course website, watching video, listening to Spotify or IMSLP audio, and recording video.  
- An active Google Apps account, using your CU IdentiKey credentials. (You all have this already, we will make a lot of use of it.)  
- An account to [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com) (a free account is fine).
- Staff paper and a pencil (bring to every class meeting).  

All other required class materials will be posted or linked to on the course site.

## The music

This semester, we will engage music in two genres: German art song (*Lieder*, singular *Lied*) and twentieth-century "art" music. Roughly half of the semester will be devoted to each, and we will engage both styles through performance, transcription, and analysis.

In addition to studying musical structures, we will place a significant emphasis on writing about musical structures. This will naturally include academic writing, but since most of you will spend the bulk of your career outside academia and/or communicating about music to non-musicians and non-academics, we will focus more on non-academic forms of writing.


## Assessment & grades

The most important and interesting aspects of learning are things that are difficult to assess fairly and reductively (i.e., with a single letter). As a result, heavy emphasis on grades tends to [undermine alternative perspectives](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/syllabus-manifesto-critical-approach-classroom-culture/)—the exact opposite of what a liberal education should do.

My goal in grading is three-fold: to diminish the significance and the negative impact grades can have on the learning environment, to direct your studies clearly (but flexibly) to specific areas that need attention, and to make sure that grades do carry some meaningful representation of the knowledge and skills you possess and gain by the end of the course.

With that in mind, assessment will be oriented around specific concepts and skills, and in order to facilitate learing, the bulk of the assessments will either allow collaboration or reassessment, if not passed on the first attempt. All assessments within a category will be weighted equally.

I have done my best to keep the assessment simple, especially since there will naturally be a little confusion about the way that this combined course will produce separate grades for theory and aural skills. All assignments will be clearly marked as counting towards theory or aural skills, and all of the section instructors, graders, and I will do our best to ensure that the course gradesbooks (in D2L) are continually up-to-date. However, when questions and confusions inevitably arise, it is your responsibility to talk to your section instructor or to me as soon as you can so that we can straighten things out.

### Final grade calculation

Following are assessment types that comprise the final Theory 4 grade:

- **Online quizzes (open-note)** - 20% of the final Theory 4 grade.  
- **Daily/weekly assignments, in-class quizzes, and Twitter essays** - 60% of the final Theory 4 grade.  
- **Academic essay midterm** - 10% of the final Theory 4 grade.  
- **"Blessay" (blog/essay) final** - 10% of the final Theory 4 grade.  

Following are assessment types that comprise the final Aural Skills 4 grade:

- **Prepared performance (voice and/or instrument)** - 30% of the final Aural Skills 4 grade.  
- **Sight-reading (voice and/or instrument)** - 20% of the final Aural Skills 4 grade.  
- **Transcription** - 50% of the final Aural Skills 4 grade.  

For further details about assessment and grades, as well as example assignments, please see the [Assessment guide](/assessments/).


## Reaching the instructor

The best ways to reach me during the course are [email](mailto:kris.shaffer@colorado.edu) or simply stopping my my office. Please allow up to two class days for a response, though during the work week, I tend to respond much more quickly than that. Messages sent on Saturday or Sunday will likely not receive a reply until Monday.


## Technical support

Students can obtain technical support for the technologies used in class by consulting Lynda.com (accessible via [MyCUInfo](https://fedauth.colorado.edu/idp/Authn/UserPassword)), the [CU OIT student help desk](http://www.colorado.edu/oit/support-training/it-service-center), and/or the instructor.
