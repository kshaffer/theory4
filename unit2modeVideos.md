## Unit II scale/collection performance portfolio instructions ##

To help you familiarize yourselves with standard scales and collections in post-tonal music, as well as to connect the sound of those collections with notation and the feel of them in your hands, please practice and record yourself singing the following scales/modes/collections ascending and descending:

- octatonic (solfège optional — sing the form that begins half-step – whole-step: do ra me mi fi sol la te do)  
- whole-tone (solfège optional — do re mi fi le te do)  
- acoustic (do re mi fi sol la te do)  
- "major" pentatonic (do re mi sol la do)  
- "minor" pentatonic (do me fa sol te do)  
- dorian (do re me fa sol la te do)  
- phrygian (do ra me fa sol le te do)  
- lydian (do re mi fi sol la ti do)  
- mixolydian (do re mi fa sol la te do)  

Please practice with an instrument, but record yourself *singing* these one octave, ascending and descending, without the aid of an instrument. You can perform in any key that is comfortable for your range. All non-diatonic collections can be found on the [Analyzying atonal music resource](http://openmusictheory.com/atonal.html).

To record and submit these videos, do the following:

- Practice the scales/collections above  
- Video yourself performing the passages, according to the instructions above  
- Name those videos "YOURLASTNAME - name of collection". (You can also perform them in a single video.)  
- Upload video(s) to the dropbox in the Aural Skills 4 D2L site

All videos most be submitted and must be performed *perfectly or nearly so* by ***8am, Friday, March 18.*** *Only videos submitted on time will be allowed a (single) reassessment opportunity.*
